Courtney LaPlante (ex-Iwrestledabearonce) is back in top form in this new project.  *Blessed Be* showcases Courtney's strong clean vocals, which might be new if you're coming to Spiritbox directly from IWABO.  Don't let Blessed Be's infectious chorus lull you into a false sense of security though -- LaPlante's vocals have lost none of their ferocity.

Looking forward to a full LP release, but also happy to see a steady stream of high quality singles in the meantime.
