Effective is Singer-Songwriter Angie McMahon's *Salt*.  This album is an easy jammer with no drop of effort wasted.  Backed by perfectly pocketed drum tracks, Angie's buzzy electric guitar drives a solid rhythm section that would be rock-n-roll enough as an instrumental album.  Then Angie's vocals take center stage and you can tell you're in for something special.

Angie's vocal range is surprising, switching from hushed whispers to full belt.  Songs usually start slow and groovy to get your attention...but don't get comfortable for too long.  Before you know it you're nodding along to a rollicking fun time.  This is a stellar debut album that deserves your attention.
