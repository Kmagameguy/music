Kiesza exploded into mainstream popularity back in 2014 with her electrifying hit _Hideaway_.  The album _Sound of a Woman_ was a monumental first entry for the Canadian multi-instrumentalist & Capoeira enthusiast.  Given _Sound of a Woman_ released in 2014, the casual listener may be lead to believe her debut was a flash in the pan -- but nothing could be further from the truth.

Unfortunately, her time in the spotlight was put on hold after being involved in a massive car wreck in 2017.  Since then, she's spent the better part of 2 years recovering from severe brain injuries.  Against the odds, and amid ongoing episodes of memory loss, visual disturbances, and overwhelming fatigue as a result of the incident, Kiesza is BACK with her sophomore release _Crave_.  The album marks the first LP released through her own label _Zebra Spirit Tribe_ and represents a stupendous comeback.

Ahead of the official release, we've already been blessed with roughly half the upcoming album's setlist.  _All of the Feelings_, _Crave_, and _Love Me with Your Lie_, each invoke an 80s pop revival akin to the latest stylings of _The Weeknd's Heartless_ and _Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia_.  _All of the Feelings_ and _Love Me with Your Lie_ are bright, glittery dance tracks that radiate late-night dance floor vibes.  Title track _Crave_ follows suit, going so far as to sound like an unreleased Michael Jackson B-side!

Don't be fooled into thinking the album is one-note, though.  _When Boys Cry_ is an intimate, sweet expression of empathy for a topic not often addressed in our culture.  And, really, intimate, personal, and uplifting are good ways to describe the overall vibe of the album.  While the current catalog doesn't showcase it, expect darker thematic elements along the way.  Given the battle Kiesza's fought, it'd be surprising if this record didn't tangle with those feelings.

_Crave_ is expected to release in mid-August.  You can find the tracks mentioned in this article over on Kiesza's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-h7O5eERbl6lLuOgYJ0GbQ){:target="_blank"}.
